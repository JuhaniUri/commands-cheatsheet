# Monitoring

One can say that monitoring can be divided two parts:

* Infra monitoring. Usually tools like Zabbix, Prometheus, Grafana, Statuscake etc. <br />
It's quite common that basic monitoring is enabled and maintained by Infra/Ops team.

* Application monitoring. Tools like Prometheus, Grafana, AppDynamics, Dynatrace etc. <br />
Is enablement comes from the developers and business side.

Good setup has a centralized logging enabled like ELK, OpenSearch etc. Logging can compliment our monitoring set.
