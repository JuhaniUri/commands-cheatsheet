---ï»¿The natural join approach tells SQL to locate any columns in the two tables with a common name, and use them to join the tables.

SELECT
    department_id,
    department_name,
    city
FROM
    departments
    NATURAL JOIN locations;

--- Left outer join

SELECT
    department_id,
    department_name,
    city
FROM
    departments
    NATURAL LEFT OUTER JOIN locations;

-- Right outer join

SELECT
    department_id,
    department_name,
    city
FROM
    departments
    NATURAL RIGHT OUTER JOIN locations;

--- Full outer join

SELECT
    department_id,
    department_name,
    city
FROM
    departments
    NATURAL FULL OUTER JOIN locations;

--using

SELECT
    department_id,
    department_name,
    city
FROM
    departments left
    JOIN locations USING ( location_id );
